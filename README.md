Welcome to the Couchbase _memcached_ project.

This started as Couchbase's fork of the upstream `memcached` project.
It has subsequently evolved since then, so while it shares a name with
the upstream project many other things have changed, apart from the
name :) For now it's simpler to consider this as the frontend of the
Couchbase key-value engine.  The primary backend of KV-engine is the
eventually persistent engine -
[ep-engine](https://github.com/couchbase/ep-engine).
